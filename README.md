Awesome Books.

For this repository, we've created this to manage book inventory. User can add and remove book from the the UI.

I used ESlint to manage the files for the front-end, using loaders for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, in order to fix some special thing at the moment to use the front-end in a server. Feel free to suggest more additional features for this repository, or if you want to use it, feel free to do that as well.
